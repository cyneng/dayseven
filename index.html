	<h1>Day Seven</h1>
	<p>Why would you separate your formatting (CSS) from your content (HTML)? So yu can apply the same formatting to several HTML elements without rewriting the same code over and over again. You can apply similar formatting to several HTML pages from one file.</p>
	<p>Previous to this, Codecademy had us practicing inline styling. Instead, everyting will be done on the stylesheet instead.</p>
